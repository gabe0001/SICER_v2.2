New modules in SICER_v2.3:



### The following two functions replace the two steps of using  make_dict_of_reads_and_windows 
### followed by get_window_counts_and_normalize. EXPLANATION OF OLD CODE, two step process. since that procedure cannot easily incorporate pile-up counting.

# line 500 of SICER_MS.py
get_window_counts

    input: iterator, genome_data, window_size, fragment_size, scaling_factor

    output: read_counts, window_counts_dict, normalized_window_array, total_reads
    
    

get_window_counts_pe

    input: iterator, genome_data, window_size, fragment_size, scaling_factor

    output: read_counts, window_counts_dict, normalized_window_array, total_reads
    
    
#The dict of dicts read_counts[chrom][window_start] contains all read counts by window and chromosome. 
#The dictionary window_counts_dict contains the same information, but downstream functions in the SICER pipeline () expect the format that window_counts_dict is in so it is currently retained. normalized_window_array also contains the same read count information but in a format suitable for a bedgraph file.
